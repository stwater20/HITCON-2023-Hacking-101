# Elk on Sesame Street - Cybersecurity Analysis in Action with ELK and BERT



Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) encompasses relevant data regarding various cybersecurity incidents on the internet, used to understand threat actors' behavior patterns, attack techniques, tools, etc., to identify potential future threats and safeguard organizational assets proactively. However, the surge of massive intelligence data has led to challenges analyzing cybersecurity incidents. To address this, we will utilize Elastic Stack (ELK) to simulate real-world data collection, analysis, and visualization environments. Furthermore, participants will be guided to develop their own intelligence integration programs to connect with open-source threat intelligence platforms.

Additionally, with the explosive growth of AI, machine learning, and deep learning methods, they are widely used in various information analyses. In this course, we will employ BERT to analyze this intelligence data, enabling rapid comprehension of intelligence contents and formulation of corresponding defense strategies.

The course consists of 6 practical experiments, making it suitable for AI beginners and students interested in accumulating knowledge in cybersecurity topics. Starting from scratch, we will cover the entire research process, including organizing data in ELK, collecting open-source threat intelligence, building a threat intelligence platform, and training deep learning models. Participants must bring their laptops and embark on an exciting journey into AI Security.
